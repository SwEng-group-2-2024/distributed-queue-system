# distributed-queue-system

Group 2's "Software Engineering Project" project -- in collaboration with Microsoft!

## Information

This project requires us to create a distributed queue API and a web app to interface it with.

Currently, the technologies we are going to be using are undecided.

## Getting Started

### Frontend

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
