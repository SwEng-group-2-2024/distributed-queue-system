# distributed-queue-system

Group 2's "Software Engineering Project" project -- in collaboration with Microsoft!

## Information

This project requires us to create a distributed queue API and a web app to interface it with.

We are using React.js for the frontend and Express.js for the backend.

## Startup instructions

At the moment starting this is a bit complicated. But worry not! Here's a walkthrough of the steps needed:

### I. Launching Frontend

Complete the following steps in order to run the frontend:

1. Install NodeJS.
2. Run `npm i` inside the root directory.
3. Run `npm start` inside the root directory.

Note: Keep this running and do not close/terminate the program.

### II. Launching Backend

In a different terminal, complete the following steps in order to run the backend:

1. Go into the `DQS` directory.
2. Run the command `node server.js`.

Note: An error may appear upon starting, this is dependent on your system.

One fix is to complete the following commands:

1. `npm uninstall bcrypt`
2. `npm install bcryptjs`
3. `npm install bcrypt`

### III. Final Steps
